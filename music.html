            chord stuff
            algorithmically find all fingerings on guitar, all voicings on piano, for all named chords
            come up with naming convention for every single combination of neocities
            "diminished" is a fun word. come up with 10 more like it (does it work this way.. tbd)
            button to play the chord
            every possible guitar method, searched in some way that finds the easiest to play and ranks them.
            "cheater versions" with skipped notes. different tunings? find asbolute easiest way to play song tuning that needs least muting and pressing of fingers.
            
            all cheater versions converge on, what, the no frets pressed chord.
